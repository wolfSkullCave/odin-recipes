      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat canola and sesame oils in a large, nonstick skillet over
        medium-high heat. Add carrot and 1/4 cup green onion; cook, stirring
        constantly, for 2 minutes. Stir in garlic powder and ginger and cook for
        2 minutes. Stir in rice, salt, and pepper; cook, stirring only once or
        twice, until rice is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in chicken
        and peas; cook for 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Push rice mixture to the sides of the pan, creating a circle in the
        middle. Add butter to the center of the pan. When melted, pour eggs into
        the center. Cook eggs, stirring often, until almost set, about 3
        minutes. Stir eggs into the rice mixture. Stir in soy sauce and rice
        vinegar; cook for 2 more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Serve immediately topped with Sriracha mayo and green onions.</li>
